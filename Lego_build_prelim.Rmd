# Data Overview
In this study, 3 people with amnesia and 9 healthy comparison participants (3 individually matched to each person with amnesia) each directed a research assistant on how to build 4 LEGO models. For two of the models (house, dog), the participant and experimenter were separated by a short barrier. The participant could see the experimenter's face but not the LEGO pieces. For the other two models (deer, dinosaur), the participant and experimenter were separated by a tall barrier that occluded all visual access. 



![Figure 1. Experimental setup in the short barrier phase. Participants (directors) instructed a research assistant (builder) on how to build a LEGO model. In this phase, participants could see the listener but not the LEGOs or building progress.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65694310/94215682-0548c180-fea3-11ea-9177-28cfc4dee48c.png)



## Dependent variables
**WordCount**: The number of total words produced by both participant (the director) and the builder to complete each Lego model.  
**GestureRate**: Average number of gestures per word produced by director during build.
**Accuracy**: Binary variable for whether model was correct at end of build; 0 = incorrect, 1 = correct.  
**BuildTime**: The number of seconds it took to build each model from start to finish.  
 
## Predictors
**Group**: Amnesia vs. Healthy Comparison Participants  
**Barrier**: short vs. tall

## Random effects
**SubjectID**  
**Object**: LEGO model (house, dog, deer, dino)

## Coding
Dummy coding.
Creating a numeric group variable with "Comparison" as reference group (0).
```{r}
dat$GroupNumeric=as.numeric(dat$Group)
dat$GroupNumeric[dat$GroupNumeric == 1] <- 1 
dat$GroupNumeric[dat$GroupNumeric == 2] <- 0 
with(dat, tapply(GroupNumeric, list(Group), mean))
```

Effects coding.
```{r}
contrasts(dat$Barrier) = cbind(short_vs_tall=c(-.5,.5))
contrasts(dat$Barrier)
```


# Word Count
## Data visualization
```{r}
ggplot(dat,
       aes("", WordCount, fill = Barrier)) +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "bar", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.9) +
  theme_classic (base_size = 18) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Word Count") +
  facet_wrap(~Group) +
  scale_fill_manual (values = c("violetred2", "gold2")) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se,
               geom = "errorbar", position = position_dodge(.9),
               size = .25, width = .5) 
```

![This LEGO plot was made possible thanks to Ryan Timpe and the ggbrickr package. This package is not yet available to the public, but keep an eye out for its release!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65694310/94280008-84291300-ff12-11ea-8e05-a47ce1633dec.png){width=75%}


## Models
Random intercept model.
```{r}
WC.glmer.0 <- glmer(WordCount ~ 1 + (1|SubjectID) + (1|Object), data = dat, family = poisson) # (1|___) is a random intercept
  summary(WC.glmer.0)
```

Calculate ICC for cluster-level variables:
8% of the variance in word count is due to between subjects differences, and only 1% of the variance is due to LEGO Object.
```{r}
summ(WC.glmer.0) #from "jtools" package
```

Random intercept with fixed effects for Group and Barrier.
```{r}
WC.glmer.1 <- glmer(WordCount ~ GroupNumeric*Barrier + (1|SubjectID) + (1|Object), data = dat, family = poisson) # GroupnNumeric*Barrier gives you the main effects of group and barrier height as well as their interaction
summary(WC.glmer.1)
```

Random intercept with random slopes for the effect of Barrier within SubjectID.
```{r}
WC.glmer.2 <- glmer(WordCount ~ GroupNumeric*Barrier + (1 + Barrier|SubjectID) + (1|Object), data = dat, family = poisson) # (Barrier|SubjectID) is a random slope for the effect of barrier height by SubjectID cluster
summary(WC.glmer.2)
```

Random intercept with random slopes for the effect of Barrier within SubjectID and LEGO Objects.
```{r}
WC.glmer.3 <- glmer(WordCount ~ GroupNumeric*Barrier + (1 + Barrier|SubjectID) + (1 + Barrier|Object), data = dat, family = poisson) #adding a random slope for (Barrier|Object) allows the effect of barrier height to vary by LEGO Model
summary(WC.glmer.3)
```

Test to see if the more complicated models are better.  
WC.glmer.2 seems to be the winner.
```{r paged.print=FALSE}
anova(WC.glmer.1,WC.glmer.2, WC.glmer.3) 
```

Multi-Level Modeling is hard. We've earned a compliment.

# Gesture Rate

## Data visualization
```{r, eval = FALSE}

    theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Gesture Rate") +
    facet_wrap(~Group) +
    scale_fill_manual (values = c("violetred2", "gold2")) +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se,
                 geom = "errorbar", position = position_dodge(.9),
                 size = .25, width = .5) #This code is for a standard bar plot, not the LEGO plot.
```

Line graph Looking at average gesture rate in short vs. tall barrier condition by Subject ID.
```{r}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = Barrier, y = GestureRate, group = SubjectID, color = SubjectID)) + 
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "line") +
  facet_wrap(~Group) +
  theme_classic()
```


## Models
Random intercept model.
```{r}
GR.lmer.0 <- lmer(GestureRate ~ 1 + (1|SubjectID) + (1|Object), data = dat)
summary(GR.lmer.0)
```

Calculate ICC for cluster-level variables: 49% of the variance in GestureRate is due to between subjects differences, and 18% of the variance is due to LEGO Object.
```{r}
summ(GR.lmer.0)
```


Random intercept with fixed effects for Group and Barrier.
```{r}
GR.lmer.1 <- lmer(GestureRate ~ GroupNumeric*Barrier + (1|SubjectID) + (1|Object), data = dat)
summary(GR.lmer.1)
```

Random intercept with random slopes for the effect of Barrier within SubjectID.
```{r}
GR.lmer.2 <- lmer(GestureRate ~ GroupNumeric*Barrier + (1 + Barrier|SubjectID) + (1|Object), data = dat)
summary(GR.lmer.2)
```

Random intercept with random slopes for the effect of Barrier within SubjectID and LEGO Objects.
Boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular.
```{r}
GR.lmer.3 <- lmer(GestureRate ~ GroupNumeric*Barrier + (1 + Barrier|SubjectID) + (1 + Barrier|Object), data = dat)
summary(GR.lmer.3)
```

Test to see if the more complicated models are better. 
Use GR.glmer.2 seems to be the winner
```{r paged.print=FALSE}
anova(GR.lmer.1, GR.lmer.2, GR.lmer.3)
```

Time for a pat on the back!

# Accuracy

## Data visualization
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(dat,
         aes("", Accuracy, fill = Barrier)) +
    stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "bar", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.9) +
    theme_classic (base_size = 18) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Accuracy") +
    facet_wrap(~Group) +
    scale_fill_manual (values = c("violetred2", "gold2")) +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se,
                 geom = "errorbar", position = position_dodge(.9),
                 size = .25, width = .5) #This code is for a standard bar plot, not the LEGO plot.
```

## Models
Random intercept model.
```{r}
ACC.glmer.0 <- glmer(Accuracy ~ 1 + (1|SubjectID) + (1|Object), data = dat, family = "binomial")
summary(ACC.glmer.0)
```

Calculate ICC for cluster-level variables: 25% of the variance in Accuracy is due to between subjects differences, and 0% of the variance is due to LEGO Object. We will remove the random slope by object.
```{r}
summ(ACC.glmer.0)
```


Random intercept with fixed predictors for Group and Barrier  
Boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular.
This model likely has too few points (only 48) for a binary variable. Based on the plot, we can test to see if there is a difference by group only and remove the barrier effect.
```{r}
ACC.glmer.1 <- glmer(Accuracy ~ GroupNumeric*Barrier + (1|SubjectID), data = dat, family = "binomial")
summary(ACC.glmer.1)
```

Random intercept with fixed effect of Group.
boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular - There are still fit issues...
```{r}
ACC.glmer.2 <- glmer(Accuracy ~ GroupNumeric + (1|SubjectID), data = dat, family = "binomial")
summary(ACC.glmer.2)
```

These models aren't converging, but we tried so here's a compliment anyway!
